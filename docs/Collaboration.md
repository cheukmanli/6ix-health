## Team Communication
We are using Discord for general team communication and Zoom for holding meetings. Updates and comments on Github Pull Requests will be sent as notifications via email.
## Project Management
We use Git and Github for our version control system and JIRA for managing and assigning tasks. We decided on using a Kanban board to manage our tasks. Since we have highly variable schedules and availability, we have not given any weights or points to our tasks. Instead, we have agreed to be open about our schedules and ask for help from other team members if we need help finishing tasks on time.
## Meetings
Meetings are held every Friday at 2pm remotely on Zoom. Meeting notes will be taken by a single person, that rotates every week. The notes will be taken on Google Docs and stored on a shared folder on Google Drive. Action items will be made into JIRA tickets, assigned a level of importance, and put into the backlog.
## Shared Documents
Shared documents are located in a shared Google Drive folder. If the document is not shareable via Google Drive, it will be posted in the Discord in a shared resources channel.
## Division of Labour/Responsibilities
Typically, tasks are made and assigned at our weekly team meeting. Team members will usually volunteer for the tasks that they are interested in. For deliverables, we will assign them randomly with a random number generator. It is expected that team members assigned less work assist the members who have more work.
