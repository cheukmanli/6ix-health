#### Contributing

Each JIRA ticket corresponds to one remote branch. The owner of each ticket opens a new Git branch to implement the feature and is free to push commits as much as needed. To merge the feature branch to the master branch, the person responsible would create a Pull Request to have at least two group members review the changes and approve the PR. After that they would squash all commits. Under no circumstances can PRs be merged without being reviewed.
