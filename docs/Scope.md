All our team members are fourth year computer science students who have all returned from their PEY. Since we have already obtained work experience through our jobs, our goals for the project are to enhance our skills required to work in a collaborative team environment to build meaningful applications, to apply and enhance our skills to learn proper processes for creating scalable frontend/backend architectures and enhance proper development skills with others.

Since we are familiar with these concepts from our work experience, our goals for the project will be to implement everything designed in the document to the best of our ability, and will not cut corners unless in the case of an absolute emergency.
